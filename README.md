# curve-fitting
Use Backpropagation to curve fitting
At first, I find the curve fitting line could be randomly when I set any eta in my loop for learning rate 1000, and I then find 0.005 seems to be the best can some times randomly get curve line rather from a straight line.
Then, I increase my learning rate to get my line fit.
So I tried:
Î· = 0.005
epoch = 1000000
after a long time I get a loss:
MSE_LOSS = 0.00317198
And the fitting figure, MSE_loss figure.
